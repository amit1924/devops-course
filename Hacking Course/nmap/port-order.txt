🎯 Lesson — Which Ports to Scan & In What Order

Until now you learned:

how to choose targets

how to discover hosts

how to choose scan techniques

Now the question is:
👉 “Out of 65,535 ports… WHICH ones should I scan? And HOW fast / in what order?”

By default:

nmap <target>


scans:
✔️ Top 1000 most common TCP ports

But YOU can control everything 😎

🟢 1️⃣ -p — Choose EXACT Ports to Scan

This is the most powerful option in this section.

✔️ Scan single port
nmap -p 80 192.168.1.10

✔️ Scan multiple ports
nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.10

✔️ Scan a range
nmap -p 1-1000 192.168.1.10

✔️ Scan ALL 65535 ports
nmap -p- 192.168.1.10


🔥 This is the FULL brutal scan

🔵 2️⃣ Scan TCP + UDP together

Normally Nmap only scans TCP.
So to scan UDP too:

nmap -sU -sS -p U:53,161,T:22,80 192.168.1.10


Breakdown:

U: = UDP ports

T: = TCP ports

Example meaning:

Scan UDP ports 53, 161

Scan TCP ports 22, 80

Without protocol prefix:
👉 Same ports get added to ALL protocol scans

🟡 3️⃣ Scan Ports by NAME 😎

Instead of numbers, you can use service names.

Example:

nmap -p ftp,http 192.168.1.10


Or wildcard:

nmap -p http* 192.168.1.10


This uses nmap-services database.

🧠 4️⃣ Intelligent Range Port Selection

Cool trick:

-p [-1024]


Meaning:
👉 Scan only ports <= 1024 that exist in service database

But usually we use numeric ports — this is extra power.

🚫 5️⃣ --exclude-ports

Sometimes you DON’T want to scan certain ports.

Example:

nmap -p- --exclude-ports 80,443 192.168.1.10


Meaning:

Scan ALL ports

Except 80 & 443

Works for:
✔️ TCP
✔️ UDP
✔️ SCTP
✔️ IP Protocol scans (-sO)

⚡ 6️⃣ Fast Scan -F

Default = 1000 ports
Fast Mode = only top 100 ports

nmap -F 192.168.1.10


Use when:
✔️ You want a quick idea
✔️ You’re scanning a big network
✔️ Time matters

🔀 7️⃣ Random vs Sequential Scan Order

By default:
👉 Nmap randomizes port order
Why?
✔️ Avoids triggering simple IDS
✔️ Avoids pattern detection
✔️ Avoids scan throttling

But if you want sequential:

nmap -r 192.168.1.10


Meaning:
→ Scan ports from lowest to highest in straight order.

Use sequential when:
✔️ Debugging
✔️ Research
✔️ Testing rate behavior

🎯 8️⃣ --top-ports — Smartest Feature

Want only most commonly used ports?

nmap --top-ports 20 192.168.1.10


Scans:
👉 Top 20 most active ports in real-world traffic

Another example:

nmap --top-ports 100 192.168.1.10


This is AWESOME for:
✔️ Pentesting
✔️ Quick recon
✔️ Practical real scans

📊 9️⃣ --port-ratio

This is more nerdy / advanced.

Every port has a popularity score in nmap database.
You can say:

nmap --port-ratio 0.5 192.168.1.10


Meaning:
👉 Scan ONLY ports that are used more than 50% of the time globally

Useful but advanced.
You’ll use top-ports more in real life.

| Option          | Meaning             |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| -p              | choose ports        |
| -p-             | all 65535 ports     |
| -F              | fast 100 ports      |
| -r              | sequential          |
| --top-ports N   | most common N ports |
| --exclude-ports | skip certain ports  |
