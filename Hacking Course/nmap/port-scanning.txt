🎯 Port Scanning Techniques — Which Tool to Use & Why

Think like a mechanic:
👉 Different problems → different tools
Same with Nmap: different scan types → different situations

But first, one important point:

✔️ Most advanced scans require root / administrator privileges
✔️ Normal users only get basic scans

Now let’s go scan-by-scan in a clean way 😊

🥇 1️⃣ SYN Scan — The KING 👑

Command:

nmap -sS <target>


This is:

Default scan (if you have root)

Fast ⚡

Reliable

Slightly stealthy

Most widely used

How it works:

Sends SYN

If reply = SYN/ACK → port OPEN

If reply = RST → port CLOSED

If no reply / ICMP blocked → FILTERED

It’s called:
👉 Half-open scan
Because it doesn’t complete the connection.

Use when:
✔️ You want speed
✔️ Good accuracy
✔️ Less noise in logs

This is the scan professionals use 90% of the time.

🥈 2️⃣ CONNECT Scan — The Backup

Command:

nmap -sT <target>


Used when:

You don’t have root

Or raw packets not allowed

How it works:

Uses OS normal connection call

Actually completes connection

Then disconnects

Downside:
❌ Slower
❌ More visible in logs
❌ More resource usage

Use when:
✔️ You don’t have administrator permission

🥉 3️⃣ UDP Scan — The Painful One 😅

Command:

nmap -sU <target>


Used to find:

DNS (53)

SNMP (161)

DHCP

VPN services

Many IoT services

Problem:
❌ Very slow
❌ Many systems throttle ICMP replies
❌ Often shows open|filtered

Still important because:
👉 Hackers LOVE UDP weaknesses

Use when:
✔️ You want complete security testing
✔️ You suspect UDP services exist

🔥 4️⃣ NULL / FIN / XMAS Stealth Scans

Commands:

nmap -sN <target>   (Null)
nmap -sF <target>   (Fin)
nmap -sX <target>   (Xmas)


These are tricky stealth scans
They exploit weird TCP RFC behavior.

Logic:

No SYN packet

If port CLOSED → sends RST

If port OPEN → ignores

So results:

RST = CLOSED

No reply = OPEN | FILTERED

Why use?
✔️ Bypass some old firewalls
✔️ Sometimes stealthy

Problems:
❌ Doesn’t work properly on Windows
❌ Many modern systems block these
❌ Often confusing output

Use when:
✔️ Testing older Unix networks
✔️ Need stealth alternatives

🧱 5️⃣ ACK Scan — Firewall Mapping

Command:

nmap -sA <target>


Important point:
👉 This scan DOES NOT find open ports.

Its job:
🔥 Detect firewall rules

Results:

RST = UNFILTERED (reachable)

No reply / ICMP = FILTERED

Use when:
✔️ You want to understand firewall behavior
✔️ Checking whether firewall is stateful

🪟 6️⃣ WINDOW Scan

Command:

nmap -sW <target>


Similar to ACK scan but:

Uses TCP window size trick

Can sometimes detect open vs closed

But:
❌ Works only on few systems
❌ Not reliable everywhere

Use when:
✔️ Testing specific legacy / older environments

🧠 7️⃣ MAIMON Scan

Command:

nmap -sM <target>


Very rare but cool trick.

Similar to FIN scan but more niche.

Use:
✔️ For curiosity / academic learning
(Not super common today)

⚙️ 8️⃣ Custom Flag Scan

Command:

nmap --scanflags <flags>


Example:

nmap --scanflags SYNFIN <target>


For advanced experts only
Lets you design your OWN scan style.

Use when:
✔️ Bypassing custom IDS rules
✔️ Experimental testing

Not beginner friendly — we’ll revisit later 😊

🌍 9️⃣ SCTP Scans (Telecom / Special Networks)

Commands:

nmap -sY   (INIT scan)
nmap -sZ   (COOKIE scan)


Used in:

Telecom networks

SS7 / SIGTRAN systems

Normal users rarely need this.

🕵️ 10️⃣ Idle Scan (The Ninja Scan)

Command:

nmap -sI zombiehost target


This is legendary 😎

Features:
✔️ 100% blind scanning
✔️ Target never sees your IP
✔️ Traffic appears from zombie host

Very advanced.
Hard to set up.
But extremely stealthy.

Used by:
✔️ elite pentesters
✔️ research scenarios

We will learn later when you’re ready 💪

🧪 11️⃣ IP Protocol Scan

Command:

nmap -sO <target>


Finds:

Which IP protocols are supported
(e.g., ICMP, TCP, IGMP etc.)

Not a port scan
but related and useful for deep analysis.

⚠️ 12️⃣ FTP Bounce Scan

Command:

nmap -b ftpserver target


Uses old FTP flaw to scan.
Mostly patched today.
Rarely works now.

| Scan            | Best Use           |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| -sS             | Best overall       |
| -sT             | No root access     |
| -sU             | UDP discovery      |
| -sN / -sF / -sX | stealth tricks     |
| -sA             | firewall detection |
| -sI             | ninja stealth      |
| -sO             | protocol scan      |
