🚀 How We Deployed Your Express App — Step-By-Step
🧱 Step-1 — We Built Our Docker Image

Inside your Express project folder (where Dockerfile exists), we built the image:

docker build -t express-demo:v2 .


📌 Meaning:

docker build → build a new image

-t express-demo:v2 → gave image a name + version

. → build from current folder

Result → You got an image:

express-demo:v2

🏷️ Step-2 — We Tagged Image For Docker Hub

Docker Hub needs images in format:

username/repository:tag


So you tagged your local image like this 👇

docker tag express-demo:v2 amit1924/express-app:v2


📌 Meaning:

Source image → express-demo:v2

Target name → amit1924/express-app:v2

Now you had:

express-demo:v2
amit1924/express-app:v2  ✔️

🔐 Step-3 — Logged Into Docker Hub

You authenticated with Docker Hub:

docker login


✔️ Login succeeded
✔️ Your PC is now allowed to upload to your Docker account

☁️ Step-4 — We Pushed Image To Docker Hub

This is when deployment actually began 🌍

docker push amit1924/express-app:v2


Docker uploaded all layers
You saw:

Pushed
digest...
done


Boom 🎉
Your app now lives on the internet inside Docker Hub!

🧠 What Did This Achieve?

You now have a cloud image like this:

docker.io/amit1924/express-app:v2


Anyone in the world can pull & run it.
Even future-you on another PC 😎

🏃‍♂️ Step-5 — We Ran The App From Docker

We deployed locally by running container:

docker run -d -p 3000:3000 amit1924/express-app:v2


📌 Meaning:

docker run → create + run a container

-d → run in background (detached)

-p 3000:3000

left = your computer port

right = port inside container

amit1924/express-app:v2 → the image we pushed

🧪 Test Like a Real Dev

Try this on any system (even your friend's PC, or later your cloud server):

docker pull amit1924/express-app:v2
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 amit1924/express-app:v2


Boom — your app runs.

That’s real deployment.

💡 “Docker commands → To push new tag” Section

It’s telling you that you can push more tags later like:

docker tag express-demo:v3 amit1924/express-app:v3
docker push amit1924/express-app:v3
